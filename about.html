    <h1>Who am I ?</h1>
    <p>
        Hey ! I am Valay. I am a tech/code nerd. I strive to be a generalist WRT technology but my current focus is towards the AI, and machine learning. This is my personal blog where I list down my thoughts. I don't write often but I like to write long form content. 

        I graduated from ASU in May 2021. Currently I am looking for my next gig and I very keen to find something it in the AI/ML space. You can find my brief CV <a target="_blank" href="https://valaydave.info/">here</a>
